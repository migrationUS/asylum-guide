需要独立证据 医疗记录 警察报告

None of these sources shows independent, first-hand knowledge of Carrion Garcia's alleged domestic abuse, and Carrion Garcia submitted no independent corroborating evidence such as medical records, police investigative reports or witness statements.

[_Mukulumbutu v. Barr977 F.3d 924](https://app.vlex.com/vid/885578786), 927 (9th Cir. 2020)

The BIA did not err in concluding that the evidence Mukulumbutu provided was entitled to limited weight because the affidavit and letters provided were from interested parties—his father, Boteti's widow, and an acquaintance**—** none of whom was available for cross-examination.

Like the [Mansour](https://app.vlex.com/vid/894313680) court, "[w]e are not comfortable with allowing a negative credibility determination in the asylum context to wash over the torture claim; especially when the prior adverse credibility determination is not necessarily significant in this situation."


[_Yali Wang v. Sessions_ , 861 F.3d 1003, 1009  (9th Cir.  2017)](https://app.vlex.com/vid/892634889)

Rather, the IJ evaluated the evidence that Wang had submitted, along with "the totality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors,"  [_id._  § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii)](https://app.vlex.com/vid/944711152), and concluded that Wang was not credible.  The IJ therefore had no obligation to give Wang an additional opportunity to bolster her case by submitting further evidence.  As we have previously held, an IJ does not "have to engage in multiple iterations of the opportunity to explain."  [_Rizk_ , 629 F.3d at 1088](https://app.vlex.com/vid/890167192).  When an IJ has considered the corroborating evidence provided by an applicant for relief but deemed that evidence insufficient, the IJ need not afford the applicant an opportunity to provide additional evidence.  _Cf.  [id.](https://app.vlex.com/vid/890167192)_

In the absence of credible testimony, the record does not compel the conclusion that Wang has "been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization" as part of a "coercive population control program,"  [8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)](https://app.vlex.com/vid/943906427), and Wang does not argue otherwise
