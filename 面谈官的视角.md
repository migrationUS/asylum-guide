**Elements of a Well-Founded Fear** 
To establish a well-founded fear of persecution, the applicant must show that the fear is genuine (the subjective basis) and that it has an objective basis in fact. 

**No Requirement of Past Harm** 
There is no requirement that the applicant have suffered harm in the past to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. 

**Objective Basis for Fear** 
The requirement of an objective basis is met if the applicant establishes that the fear of persecution is reasonable; i.e., that there is a reasonable possibility of suffering persecution in the future. 

**The Mogharrabi Test** 
If an applicant establishes all four prongs of the Mogharrabi test, as modified by Matter of Kasinga and Pitcherskaia v. INS53, the fear of persecution is well-founded. The elements of the four-prong test are 1) applicant possesses (or is believed to possess) a protected characteristic; 2) persecutor is aware or could become aware that applicant possesses the characteristic; 3) persecutor is capable of persecuting applicant; and 4) persecutor is inclined to persecute applicant.

Pattern or Practice 
An applicant does not need to show that he or she will be singled out if there is 1) a pattern or practice of persecution of a group or category of individuals similarly situated to the applicant, and 2) the applicant belongs to or is identified with the group or category of persons such that a reasonable person in the applicant’s position would fear persecution. Persecution of Family Members or Close Associates Persecution of family members or others associated with the applicant may be objective evidence that the applicant’s fear is well founded. However, the applicant must establish some connection between such persecution and the persecution the applicant fears.
