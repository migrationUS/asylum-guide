**Elements of a Well-Founded Fear** 
To establish a well-founded fear of persecution, the applicant must show that the fear is genuine (the subjective basis) and that it has an objective basis in fact. 

**No Requirement of Past Harm** 
There is no requirement that the applicant have suffered harm in the past to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. 

**Objective Basis for Fear** 
The requirement of an objective basis is met if the applicant establishes that the fear of persecution is reasonable; i.e., that there is a reasonable possibility of suffering persecution in the future. 

**The Mogharrabi Test** 
If an applicant establishes all four prongs of the Mogharrabi test, as modified by Matter of Kasinga and Pitcherskaia v. INS53, the fear of persecution is well-founded. The elements of the four-prong test are 1) applicant possesses (or is believed to possess) a protected characteristic; 2) persecutor is aware or could become aware that applicant possesses the characteristic; 3) persecutor is capable of persecuting applicant; and 4) persecutor is inclined to persecute applicant.

**Pattern or Practice** 
An applicant does not need to show that he or she will be singled out if there is 1) a pattern or practice of persecution of a group or category of individuals similarly situated to the applicant, and 2) the applicant belongs to or is identified with the group or category of persons such that a reasonable person in the applicant’s position would fear persecution. 

**Persecution of Family Members or Close Associates** 
Persecution of family members or others associated with the applicant may be objective evidence that the applicant’s fear is well founded. However, the applicant must establish some connection between such persecution and the persecution the applicant fears.

**Threats** 
Threats (anonymous or otherwise) may be sufficient to establish a well-founded fear if the applicant establishes that there is a reasonable possibility the threats will be carried out. If the threat is anonymous, you should consider all possible sources of the threat, the content of the threat, circumstances surrounding the threat, and country conditions information. 

**Applicant Remains in Country after Threats or Harm** 
A significant lapse of time between the incidents that give rise to the claim and the applicant’s departure from the country may indicate that the fear is not well-founded. However, the reasons and circumstances for delayed departure must be considered. 

**Return to Country of Persecution** 
An applicant’s return to the country of feared persecution generally weakens the applicant’s claim of a well-founded fear of persecution. Consideration must be given to the reasons the applicant returned and what happened to the applicant once he or she returned. Return to the country of feared persecution does not necessarily defeat an applicant’s claim. 

**Possession of Travel Documents** 
Possession of valid travel documents does not preclude eligibility for refugee or asylum status, but may indicate that the applicant’s government does not have the inclination to harm the applicant. All of the circumstances surrounding acquisition of such documents must be considered.

**Refugee Sur Place**
An applicant may become a refugee due to events that occur while the applicant is outside his or her country. These events may be changed circumstances in the applicant’s country, or actions the applicant takes while outside of his or her country that put him or her at risk if the applicant returns to the country. 

**Internal Relocation** 
A fear is not well-founded if the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of his or her country, and, under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so. You must consider whether the persecutor is the government or is government-sponsored; the extent of the authority of the persecutor; and any factors that may make it unreasonable for the applicant to relocate. In the Asylum context, the burden of proof shifts to the officer to show that the applicant could reasonably relocate to avoid future persecution if past persecution has been established or if the persecutor is the government or is government-sponsored. 

**Country of Origin Information** 
You must consider current conditions in the applicant’s country to evaluate whether an applicant’s fear of future persecution is well-founded.
