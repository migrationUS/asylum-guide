Chinese and Hong Kong students studying abroad are living in fear of intimidation, harassment and surveillance as Chinese authorities seek to prevent them engaging with “sensitive” or political issues. This climate of fear on campuses in Europe and North America is the result of Chinese authorities’ transnational repression against overseas students, in violation of their human rights. The chilling effect engendered by these efforts prompts broad self-censorship in academic and social settings, and many affected students experience loneliness, isolation and negative mental health impacts.

There were ongoing concerns about the repression of dissent overseas, including pressure by the Chinese authorities on other countries to forcibly repatriate Chinese nationals who faced arbitrary detention, torture and other human rights violations if returned. In July, human rights lawyer Lu Siwei was detained by police in Laos and forcibly repatriated to China in September where he was detained for several weeks. Although released on bail, Lu Siwei’s freedom of movement and expression remained severely restricted.[6](https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/asia-and-the-pacific/east-asia/china/report-china/#endnote-7)

In July, the family of Yang Zewei were informed that he was detained in a juvenile detention centre in Hunan’s Hengyang city. This followed reports that he was arrested in Laos in May after launching an online campaign to end internet censorship in China.

• The People’s Republic of China (PRC) continued a multifaceted campaign of transnational repression against Hong Kongers, Ti- betans, Uyghurs, journalists, Chinese university students, and others to stifle dissent and intimidate individuals in emigrant and diaspora communities. Examples include the issuance of HK$1,000,000 (US$127,600) bounties on 13 overseas activists, intelligence-gathering efforts in diaspora communities, and the harassment of China-based relatives of overseas targets. 
• The PRC’s transnational repression efforts were observed leading up to, during, and after the November 2023 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in San Francisco, Cali- fornia. 
• This reporting year, the Commission observed reports of PRC authorities forcibly repatriating overseas Chinese citizens Lu Siwei and Yang Zewei, also known as Qiao Xinxin, through extrajudicial means.

Chinese authorities continued to severely curtail rights to freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly, including through the abusive application of laws often under the pretext of preserving national security.

People who participated in events to commemorate the victims of an apartment block fire in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, in November 2022 and associated protests against restrictive Covid-19 policies (known as the A4 protests or White Paper Revolution due to protesters holding blank sheets of paper) continued to face harassment. Among the dozens of mainly young protesters believed to have been detained were Cao Zhixin, Li Yuanjing, Zhai Dengrui and Li Siqi, who were released on bail in April after being held for approximately four months.
