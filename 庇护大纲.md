[第九巡回法院庇护指导大纲](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/uploads/immigration/immig_west/B.pdf)

## 如何符合庇护条件

1. 过去被迫害 过
2. 对未来遭受迫害的合理恐惧
基于**种族**、**宗教**、**国籍**、**特定社会群体成员身份**，或**政治观点**

中国人一般是 宗教 或者 政治观点 / 种族(新疆维吾尔族人) / 计划生育

⭐️ 经济纠纷(拆迁)/政府官员或者国企的腐败导致自己利益受损或者被歧视打压 都不满足 必须上升到反对政府反对体制反对CCP的高度才符合政治观点类别

“A ‘refugee’ is defined as any person who is unwilling or unable to return to her home country ‘because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.

The applicant may qualify as a refugee either because he or she has suffered past persecution or because he or she has a well-founded fear of future persecution.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b).

Once past persecution is demonstrated, then fear of future persecution is presumed, and the burden shifts to the government to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution, or [t]he applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant’s country.

## 什么是迫害？

迫害是一个极端的概念, 普通的歧视和骚扰不算

“Persecution … is an extreme concept that means something considerably more than discrimination or harassment.”


宗教案例:

[Guo v. Ashcroft](https://app.vlex.com/vid/888074633) ✅
There, the police arrested Guo while he was attending home-church services, which they deemed an illegal religious gathering.  [_Guo_ , 361 F.3d at 1197](https://app.vlex.com/vid/888074633).  After Guo asserted that he had the right to be a Christian, an officer struck him in the face twice, "ordered him to do push ups until he could no longer stand it[,]" and then kicked him in the stomach.  [_Id_](https://app.vlex.com/vid/888074633) .  Guo was detained for a day and a half and released after being forced to sign an affidavit attesting that he would no longer believe in Christianity.  [_Id_](https://app.vlex.com/vid/888074633) .

A week later, Guo was visiting a congregant's tomb and witnessed a police officer removing a cross from it.  [_Id._](https://app.vlex.com/vid/888074633)  When he attempted to stop the defacement, the officer used an electric baton to subdue him.  [_Id_](https://app.vlex.com/vid/888074633) . at 1197–98.  Guo was then taken to the police station, where the same officer "hit him in the face seven or eight times" and then beat him with a plastic pole.  _Id_ . at 1198.  Guo was detained for fifteen days.  _Id_ .  Afterwards, his employer terminated him, and he was unable to find other work in China.

[Gu v. Gonzales](https://app.vlex.com/vid/892936735) ❌

By contrast, we denied the petition in [_Gu_](https://app.vlex.com/vid/892936735) , where Chinese police arrested the petitioner for disseminating Christian materials in public.  [454 F.3d at 1017–18](https://app.vlex.com/vid/892936735).  During his interrogation, the police struck Gu in the back with a rod ten times.  [_Id._ at 1018](https://app.vlex.com/vid/892936735).  He  "testified that he was in pain at the time and that the strikes left temporary red marks, but required no medical treatment[,]" and "that no scars, bruises, welts, or injuries of any kind remain[ed]."  [_Id_](https://app.vlex.com/vid/892936735) .  Although Gu was required to report to the police every week for a period of time, "he did not experience further problems, was able to return to his government job, and obtained a valid passport to leave China."

因为公开传播基督教材料被捕
背部被棍打 有暂时的红色印记 但是不需要医疗治疗 没有留下伤疤
还是能回到他的政府工作并且拿到护照离开

Moreover, we found that the record did "not demonstrate that Gu was objectively unable to attend his household church.  Although Gu testified that he  ‘did not dare’ attend his household church after his arrest, he also testified that the authorities did not prevent him from attending the household church.

没有证据表明他不能参加家庭教会

区别：
In distinguishing these facts from [_Guo_](https://app.vlex.com/vid/888074633) , we reasoned that "the petitioner  [in [_Guo_](https://app.vlex.com/vid/888074633) ] was able to show repeated, lengthy and severe harassment." Gu, by contrast, "was detained and beaten on only one occasion, Gu's interrogation lasted only two hours, Gu did not require medical treatment and Gu did not have any adverse employment consequences."

[Zhihui  Guo v. Sessions](https://app.vlex.com/search/jurisdiction:US/Guo+v.+Sessions/vid/891928689) ✅

“[A] beating may constitute persecution, even when there are no long-term effects and the [petitioner] does not seek medical attention.

Moreover, the absence of serious bodily injury is not necessarily dispositive

(finding past persecution based on totality of circumstances where petitioner suffered physical harm, in addition to being forced to abandon his religious worship; as to the physical harm, petitioner testified that while in police custody, he suffered repeated baton blows that left him unable to stand on his own, such that police had to help him back to his cell, and he felt it was necessary to be examined at a hospital after his release two days after the beating

[Xinbing Song v. Sessions](https://app.vlex.com/search/jurisdiction:US/xinbing-song-v-sessions/vid/895233519)
Two police officers entered the apartment, overpowered his efforts to resist, and took Song to a detention center.  He was charged with interfering with official duties.  During the three days Song was jailed, police tortured and beat him, and encouraged his cell mates to do the same.  Song was forced to spend an entire night in a squatting position.  The police also interrogated him about his alleged crime.

Prison officials accused Song of being "anti-government,"  "subvert[ing] the government," and "preventing the [government] official from doing official duties."  They tried to get Song to confess to the same.  When Song refused, police beat him with a baton and electric baton until he passed out.  Song suffered multiple injuries from the beatings, to the point that he was unable to walk.



## 过去受过迫害

1. 你的经历达到了迫害的程度
2. 迫害是基于一个或多个受保护的理由
3. 迫害方是政府或者政府无法控制的力量 (中国人都满足)

“An applicant alleging past persecution has the burden of establishing that (1) his treatment rises to the level of persecution; (2) the persecution was on account of one or more protected grounds; and (3) the persecution was committed by the government, or by forces that the government was unable or unwilling to control.”

## 对未来遭受迫害的合理恐惧

1. 过去完全没被伤害过 (留学生)
2. 过去被伤害过但是达不到迫害的标准 (绝大多数)

Absent evidence of past persecution, [an applicant] must establish a well-founded fear of future persecution by showing both a subjective fear of future persecution, as well as an objectively ‘reasonable possibility’ of persecution upon return to the country in question.”

Moreover, past harm not amounting to persecution is relevant to the reasonableness of an applicant’s fear of future persecution.

An applicant may demonstrate a well-founded fear by showing that he has been targeted for persecution.

1. Targeted for Persecution 

2. Pattern and Practice of Persecution 
(A) The applicant establishes that there is a pattern or practice in his or her country … of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; and (B) The applicant establishes his or her own inclusion in, and identification with, such group of persons such that his or her fear of persecution upon return is reasonable.

[官方定义的邪教](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/441219-CHINA-2022-INTERNATIONAL-RELIGIOUS-FREEDOM-REPORT.pdf):  
The government also characterizes a number of Christian groups as “cult organizations,” including the **Shouters**, **CAG** (also known as Eastern Lightning), **Society of Disciples** (Mentu Hui), **Full Scope Church** (Quan Fanwei Jiaohui), **Spirit Sect**, **New Testament Church**, **Three Grades of Servants** (San Ban Puren), **Association of Disciples**, **Established King Church**, **Family Federation for World Peace and Unification** (Unification Church), **Family of Love**, and **South China Church**.

[家庭教会](https://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/2024%20Annual%20Report.pdf)  
Persecution of Protestant house church Christians intensified. The government continued its nationwide crackdown on house churches, detaining, arresting, and sentencing independent Protestants on security and criminal charges. Authorities tortured Christians held in secret detention centers and prisons. Authorities in Henan Province required Protestants to register on a government “smart-religion” app to attend worship services. Authorities also continued to persecute ethnic minority Protestants, such as Miao, Lisu, and Nu Christians.
